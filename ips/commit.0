TASK: Write a git commit message for the DIFF attached at the end of this task using the styleguide below. 

STYLEGUIDE:

As a general rule, your messages should start with a single line that’s  no more than about 50 characters and that describes the changeset  concisely, followed by a blank line, followed by a more detailed  explanation. The Git project requires that the more detailed explanation include your  motivation for the change and contrast its implementation with previous  behavior - this is a good guideline to follow. Write your commit message in the imperative: "Fix bug" and not "Fixed bug" or "Fixes bug." Here is a template you can follow, which we’ve lightly adapted from one originally written by Tim Pope:

\`\`\`md
Capitalized, short (50 chars or less) summary

More detailed explanatory text, if necessary.  Wrap it to about 72
characters or so.  In some contexts, the first line is treated as the
subject of an email and the rest of the text as the body.  The blank
line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless you omit
the body entirely); tools like rebase will confuse you if you run the
two together.

Write your commit message in the imperative: "Fix bug" and not "Fixed bug"
or "Fixes bug."  This convention matches up with commit messages generated
by commands like git merge and git revert.

Further paragraphs come after blank lines.

- Bullet points are okay, too

- Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, followed by a
  single space, with blank lines in between, but conventions vary here

- Use a hanging indent

The diff follows:

\`\`\`diff
{DIFF=\`git show --format="" -p --stat HEAD\`}
\`\`\`
