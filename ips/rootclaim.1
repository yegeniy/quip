## For the following analysis, please use this structured format:

1. HYPOTHESIS FORMATION
- List competing hypotheses
- Establish prior probability based on base rates
- Show your baseline calculations

2. EVIDENCE EVALUATION
For each piece of evidence:
- P(E|H) - probability if hypothesis true
- P(E|~H) - probability if hypothesis false
- Likelihood ratio calculation
- Show impact on probability

3. BAYESIAN UPDATING
- Show each step of probability updates
- Include intermediate calculations
- Explain major probability shifts

4. UNCERTAINTY ANALYSIS
- List key uncertainties
- Assess their potential impact
- Consider alternative scenarios

5. FINAL ASSESSMENT
- Provide final probability estimate
- State confidence level
- Explain key factors
- Make clear betting recommendation if applicable
