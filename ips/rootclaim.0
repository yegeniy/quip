## I want to analyze a question using structured probabilistic inference following the Rootclaim method. Please help me:

1. First establish baseline probabilities
2. Evaluate each piece of evidence systematically
3. Show Bayesian updating calculations
4. Consider key uncertainties
5. Provide a final probability estimate with confidence level

Please confirm you understand this approach before I present my question.
