Generate an ordered list of discrepancies between the job posting and the resume.
A few rules you must follow:

- Each discrepancy must be on a single line.
- Prefix the discrepancies with this exactly: Quiz me on this discrepancy between the resume and the job posting, like at an interview.
- Wrap everything in a codeblock \`\`\`yaml to make it easier to copy.
- Interleave each line with this line exactly: answer them assuming I don't have the experience, but do have the knowldege
